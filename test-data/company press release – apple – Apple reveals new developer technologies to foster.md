Powerful APIs enable developers to create all-new app experiences

Xcode 12 is at the center of all development on Apple's platforms and features a fresh new look.

Cupertino, California â€” Apple today announced a robust line-up of new technologies to help its 23 million developers design and build the apps of tomorrow. These new tools will enable developers to bring more powerful app experiences to Apple's industry-leading platforms, and help them better manage and grow their businesses. In addition to Apple's annual developer survey, [WWDC20](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/) will feature an online App Store lab so that developers from around the world can share their feedback and help inform future improvements to the App Store. Apple is also adding new forums for developers to relay suggestions throughout the coming year and beyond.

"The Apple developer community inspires us all with apps that help more than a billion users, transform industries, and change the world. This WWDC, we've introduced innovative new APIs, frameworks, and tools designed to help developers take their app experiences further and reach even more users," said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. "The App Store ecosystem is more diverse, dynamic, and successful than it has ever been, but we know that to make it better for everyone, there is more we must do together. This year at WWDC20, we've added online App Store Labs, extended the annual App Store developer survey, and more because we want to hear directly from hundreds of thousands of developers on how they want us to improve the App Store for them, and for users."

## New Ways to Reach Users with App Clips and Widgets

Widgets have also been redesigned to be more helpful and give users timely information at a glance. With widgets on the Home Screen pages, users can experience the developer's widget every time they look at their device. And with a new SwiftUI API, developers can use the same code to build a widget for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

App Clips give developers a fun, easy, and seamless way to reach new users.

## Greater Access to Apple Platforms

This year, Apple is providing developers with even more ways to deeply integrate their apps into core platform features in order to deliver powerful functionality in a way that also protects user privacy and security. The new Find My network accessory program lets third-party device makers take advantage of a network with hundreds of millions of devices, while continuing to offer end-to-end encryption so only the user can see the location of their item. HomePod also has a new program to integrate third-party music services. Email and browser app developers can offer their apps as default options, selectable by users. And Safari for Mac is adding support for the popular WebExtensions API used by Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, making it easy for extension developers to work with Safari, and distribute through the Mac App Store.

The Find My network will be open to third-party device makers with end-to-end encryption built in.

SwiftUI adds great new features to make sharing code across Apple's platforms even easier.

## New SwiftUI Capabilities

## More Customizable Apps with Mac Catalyst

Debuting alongside macOS Catalina at WWDC 2019, Mac Catalyst made it easy for developers to bring their iPad apps to the Mac. With macOS Big Sur, Mac Catalyst apps automatically inherit the spacious new design, while giving developers powerful new APIs and greater control over the behavior of their apps. And now developers can choose to keep their Mac app scaled at a resolution to match their iPad app, or take total control of their Mac interface to create a truly custom Mac experience. Developers can distribute their Mac Catalyst apps to customers in 175 countries on the Mac App Store, and let customers easily enjoy apps and in-app purchases across Mac, iPhone, and iPad with universal purchase.

New APIs in Mac Catalyst offer developers entirely new levels of control when bringing their iPad app to the Mac.

## An Online App Store Lab and New App Store Review Processes

During WWDC20, Apple is also launching an online version of the App Store lab to further support the Apple developer community across all of its platforms. In the past, the in-person App Store lab has helped inform and prioritize new App Store features and capabilities, as well as updates to App Store policies. This year, developers are encouraged to share their feedback at the virtual lab or through an additional survey channel which will collect submissions through June 26. The survey, now in its fourth year, reaches half a million developers and represents a critical pathway of feedback for improvements leading to App Store developer services such as TestFlight public links and the ability to respond to customer reviews.

## New Levels of Privacy Transparency

Developers can now better inform and educate users of their app's privacy policies right in the App Store.

## Other Developer Features

- **ARKit 4** introduces new ways to capture information about the real world using a new **Depth API** that is designed to work with the LiDAR sensor in iPad Pro, enabling entirely new types of apps, such as on-site architecture, design, landscaping, and manufacturing.
- Machine learning development is easier and more extensive with additional tools in **Core ML** for model deployment and encryption, new templates and training capabilities in **Create ML**, and more APIs for vision and natural language.
- **PencilKit** now features Scribble, which makes it easy to create apps with text entry fields that users can write in with Apple Pencil. Developers will also have access to stroke data using PencilKit, all while seamlessly handling both Apple Pencil input and system touch gestures.
- **TestFlight** now supports up to 100 team members for fast build distribution.
- **AirPods Motion API** gives developers access to movement data in real time.
